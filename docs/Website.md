# Building the Conference Website

The website must be setup a minimum 6 months in advance to the conference, this can be handled by the general website team of the developer community. The website must focus on providing a clear picture of what the conference contains. A front page to the conference, the content should be thoroughly checked and made precise as possible. 

## Maintaining the Domain

The conference will serve as the fund source for maintaining the MEC.dev domain name. It falls upon the conference organisers to register and maintain the domain and website. The conference is though not responsible for funding most other activities of the developer community. The funds can thus only be alloted for the domain name purchase. This shall be done every year in the month of May and is the responsibility of the mentor to guide the committee through this process.

## Conf.MEC.dev the website

The content of the website should also contain the exact details without fail at all times and wherever found necessary. Use of an issue tracker to get suggestions is necessary and must be a practice that is prevalent throughout the community.
